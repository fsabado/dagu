# Spec: Human Tasks

## Status

Implemented.

## Scope

This spec defines:

- the `action: human.task` step shape
- the root-DAG-only execution boundary
- prompt resolution
- integration with the shared scalar-input schema
- generated step outputs
- the `waiting` checkpoint
- the local completion and push-back commands
- atomic completion and push-back, idempotency, and resume
- local and distributed root-run behavior
- dry-run and error behavior

This spec does not define:

- `approval` behavior
- scheduler algorithms, queue protocols, or worker negotiation
- REST, Web UI, MCP, notification, authentication, or authorization behavior
- nested form objects or arrays

## Goal

A root workflow can stop at a processless step, accept an acknowledgement or a
small typed object, and continue the same DAG run later. Waiting must not keep
an executor process or distributed worker slot occupied.

Declared form values become ordinary step outputs under
`${steps.<id>.outputs.<property>}`. The completion command identifies the task
by that explicit step `id`.

A task that declares `with.push_back` can instead send the work back. A
push-back runs an upstream step and every step that depends on it again with
the operator's feedback, then opens the task again for another review.

## Terms

A human-task step has action exactly `human.task`.

The owning run is the DAG run containing the step.

A root DAG run has no parent DAG run. A child DAG run is invoked through
`dag.run`, `dag.enqueue`, or `parallel`.

An open human task is a human-task step in node status `waiting` that has not
accepted completion input.

Canonical input is the validated completion object after string coercion and
defaults. It determines idempotency and generated output values.

A waiting checkpoint is a finalized root-run state with overall status
`waiting` and no ordinary node still ready or running.

Resume continues the same logical root run under the same DAG-run ID while
preserving completed nodes and outputs.

The rewind target is the step named by `with.push_back.rewind_to`.

A step's push-back iteration is the iteration of the last push-back that reset
it, or `0` when no push-back has. A push-back records one more than the highest
push-back iteration among the task and the steps it resets, so a step's
iteration only increases.

## Behavior

### Step Shape

Minimal acknowledgement-only task:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: acknowledge
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm that maintenance has started
```

Fields owned by this spec:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | Yes | Must be `human.task`. |
| `id` | Yes | Step identity used for completion and output references. |
| `with.prompt` | Yes | Instructions for the operator. |
| `with.form` | No | Flat typed input object. Omit for acknowledgement only. |
| `with.artifacts` | No | Artifact-relative paths available as review context. |
| `with.push_back` | No | Lets the operator push the task back to an upstream step. |

Rules:

- The step must define an explicit `id` accepted by Spec 009.
- `name` does not satisfy the explicit `id` requirement.
- `with` must be an object containing only `prompt`, optional `form`, optional
  `artifacts`, and optional `push_back`.
- `with.prompt` must be a string containing a non-whitespace character before
  runtime value resolution.
- `with.form: null` is invalid. Acknowledgement-only tasks omit `form`.
- `with.artifacts`, when present, must be an array of unique, non-empty strings.
  Each path is relative to the current root DAG run's artifact directory. The
  authored text must not be absolute, home-relative, or contain
  parent-directory segments.
- `with.artifacts` entries are value-resolved with `with.prompt` when the task
  opens, so an entry can name an artifact a dependency produced. Command
  substitution is never run.
- Each resolved path is re-checked against the same relative-path rules. A
  resolved path that is empty, absolute, home-relative, or contains a
  parent-directory segment fails the step without opening it.
- Two entries that resolve to the same path contribute one artifact reference,
  positioned at the first authored occurrence.
- `with.artifacts` references artifacts that other steps in the run produce. It
  does not itself enable artifact storage for the DAG, unlike the `artifact.*`
  actions of Spec 051, and a DAG that stores no artifacts is still valid.
- The waiting-task snapshot stores resolved artifact paths only; it never copies
  artifact contents into human-task state. Missing or unavailable referenced
  artifacts do not change task completion or resume semantics.
- A human task without `artifacts` behaves exactly as it did before artifact
  references were introduced.
- A human task starts no command, executor, container, or child DAG.
- `name`, `description`, `depends`, `working_dir`, `env`, `preconditions`, and
  `continue_on` retain their owning behavior.
- Defaults for `env`, `preconditions`, and `continue_on` apply.
- Process-oriented defaults do not add retry, repeat, timeout, notification,
  or signal behavior to a human task.

The following authored fields are invalid even when set to an empty or false
value:

- execution: `run`, `type`, `exec`, `command`, `script`, `call`, `config`,
  `llm`, `messages`, `params`, `routes`, and `value`
- shell: `shell`, `shell_args`, and `shell_packages`
- placement: `container` and step-level `worker_selector`
- lifecycle: `retry_policy`, `repeat_policy`, `timeout_sec`, and
  `signal_on_stop`
- iteration: `foreach` and `parallel`
- approval: `approval`
- output and logging: `stdout`, `stderr`, `log_output`, `output`,
  `output_schema`, and authored `outputs`
- failure notification: `mail_on_error`

### Human Tasks Are Not Approval Steps

`human.task` is a standalone step that waits without first executing a
process. `approval` is attached to another executable step and is outside this
spec.

A human task supports two results. Completion makes the step `succeeded` with
validated input. Push-back, available when `with.push_back` is configured, runs
the rewind target and the steps that depend on it again before the task opens
again.

### Root DAG Boundary

Rules:

- A human-task step can execute only in a root DAG run.
- A root DAG containing human tasks can execute locally or on a distributed
  worker.
- Human tasks do not add an implicit local worker selector.
- DAG-level worker selection continues to apply.
- A child DAG containing a human task fails before the child starts or creates
  child-run state.
- The child rejection applies to `dag.run`, `dag.enqueue`, and `parallel`.
- A human task is invalid inside `foreach.steps` or any `handler_on` handler.

A DAG definition containing human tasks is valid when executed directly as a
root. Its possible use by another DAG does not make static validation fail.

For multi-document YAML, static validation accepts a later named document that
contains a human task. Invoking that document as a child fails at runtime.

### Preconditions And Prompt

Rules:

- Step preconditions run before the task opens according to Spec 023.
- If preconditions are not met, the step becomes `skipped` and accepts no
  completion.
- A precondition evaluation error follows Spec 023 failure behavior.
- `with.prompt` is value-resolved after dependencies and preconditions allow
  the step to start.
- Prompt resolution uses parameters, constants, environment values, built-in
  context, and dependency outputs defined by Specs 003, 006, and 007.
- `with.artifacts` entries are value-resolved in the same step, from the same
  scope, and under the artifact path rules of this spec.
- The resolved prompt and resolved artifact paths are fixed for that open task.
- Changing the DAG file or process environment after the task opens does not
  change the prompt or artifact paths observed by status or resume.
- A prompt-resolution error fails the step without opening it.
- An artifact-path resolution error, or a resolved path that is not a safe
  relative artifact path, fails the step without opening it.
- Form schemas and their metadata are literal and are not value-resolved.

### Form Integration

When present, `with.form` is a flat object schema:

| Root field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | Must be `object`. |
| `title` | No | String display metadata. |
| `description` | No | String help metadata. |
| `properties` | No | Map of scalar field schemas using the same shape as schema-backed DAG parameters. Defaults to `{}`. |
| `required` | No | List of unique declared property names. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `additionalProperties` | No | Whether undeclared input is accepted. Defaults to `false`. |

Rules:

- A root field not listed in the table is invalid.
- Property names must match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`.
- Every `required` name must be declared in `properties`.
- Declared properties use the same scalar field shape, validation, and
  string-coercion behavior as schema-backed DAG parameters. Supported property
  types are `string`, `integer`, `number`, and `boolean`; supported fields are
  `type`, `title`, `description`, `default`, `enum`, `oneOf`, `minimum`,
  `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, and `pattern`.
- Nested declared objects and arrays are invalid.
- Defaults and declared values are validated by the shared parameter-field
  rules.
- Defaults are applied before this form enforces `required`.
- An omitted optional property without a default remains absent.
- `additionalProperties: false` rejects every undeclared input property.
- `additionalProperties: true` retains undeclared properties in canonical
  input without creating step outputs for them.
- Through `--input`, an accepted undeclared value is a string.
- Through `--inputs-json`, an accepted undeclared value retains any valid JSON
  shape, including `null`, objects, and arrays.

### Generated Step Outputs

Rules:

- Every declared form property creates an output declaration with the same
  name.
- Authors must not declare `outputs` on a human-task step.
- A declared `string` property creates a `string` output.
- A declared `integer`, `number`, or `boolean` property creates a `json`
  output.
- A property publishes a value only when canonical input contains it.
- Undeclared properties never become outputs.
- Output values come directly from canonical input. Human tasks do not use
  stdout or `DAGU_OUTPUT_FILE`.
- A consumer uses `${steps.<human-task-id>.outputs.<property>}` and must depend
  directly or transitively on the human-task step.
- Completed outputs remain available after resume.

String outputs expose their string contents. Other scalar outputs expose their
JSON scalar text. Human-task publication is an explicit exception to Spec
012's file-producer behavior.

Canonical input and the generated-output object must each fit within the
owning DAG's `max_output_size`. A size error occurs before completion changes
the task.

### Push-Back Configuration

When present, `with.push_back` enables push-back for the task:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rewind_to` | Yes | Step `id` or `name` that runs again first after a push-back. |
| `form` | No | Flat feedback object. Omit when push-back accepts no input. |

Rules:

- `with.push_back` must be an object containing only `rewind_to` and optional
  `form`. `with.push_back: null` is invalid.
- `rewind_to` must be a non-empty string naming a step in the same DAG that the
  task depends on directly or transitively. The task itself is invalid.
- `with.push_back.form` follows Form Integration, except that
  `additionalProperties` must be `false`. Omitting it means `false`.
- `with.push_back.form: null` is invalid. Push-back without input omits `form`.
- Feedback properties never become step outputs.
- `with.push_back` is invalid in a `type: agent` DAG.
- The push-back configuration is literal and is not value-resolved.

### Opening A Waiting Checkpoint

When the step becomes ready, Dagu:

1. evaluates preconditions
2. resolves the prompt and artifact paths
3. changes the step to `waiting`
4. continues independent ready or running branches
5. finalizes the root run as `waiting` after no ordinary node remains ready or
   running
6. releases the execution process or distributed worker slot

Rules:

- Dependencies of the open task do not start.
- Several independent human tasks can be `waiting` in one checkpoint.
- A foreground local run that reaches a waiting checkpoint exits successfully.
- A distributed attempt that reaches a waiting checkpoint releases its worker
  capacity before the checkpoint is actionable.
- Once `dagu status` reports the waiting checkpoint, a valid completion command
  must not fail because the prior attempt is still finalizing.
- An open task has no step timeout or automatic expiration.

### Waiting Status Observation

The black-box status surface is:

```sh
dagu status --run-id <run-id> <root-dag-name>
```

For a waiting checkpoint, the command exits zero with empty stderr. Stdout must
identify:

- overall status `Waiting`
- each waiting human task's explicit step ID
- each task's resolved prompt
- each task's resolved artifact paths when the task declares any
- each task's normalized form as JSON when a form exists
- each task's rewind target when the task declares `with.push_back`
- each task's normalized feedback form as JSON when it declares one
- each task's push-back iteration when it is greater than `0`

The displayed normalized form must:

- contain root `type`, `properties`, and explicit `additionalProperties`
- preserve authored root metadata and `required` names
- preserve supported scalar metadata and constraints
- contain each property's resolved scalar type

Omitted `properties` is displayed as `{}`. Other omitted optional fields can
remain omitted. Exact object-member order is not significant.

### Completion Command

The completion operation is:

```sh
dagu human-task complete [flags] <root-dag-name>
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | Yes | Owning root DAG-run ID. |
| `--step` | Yes | Explicit human-task step ID. |
| `--input key=value` | No | One string input; repeat for multiple properties. |
| `--inputs-json object` | No | One typed JSON input object. |

Rules:

- The DAG name and run ID must identify one stored root run.
- `--step` is trimmed and matches the explicit step `id`, never `name` or a
  generated task identifier.
- The command runs only in a local CLI context with direct run-store access.
- The owning root run itself can have executed locally or remotely.
- `--input` and `--inputs-json` are mutually exclusive.
- Omitting both supplies `{}`.
- Completion uses the DAG snapshot and form belonging to the run. It does not
  reload the current DAG file.
- No reconciliation command is required before or after completion.

### `--input` Parsing

Rules:

- Each occurrence must contain `=`.
- The property name is the trimmed text before the first `=` and must not be
  empty.
- The value is every character after the first `=`; additional `=` characters
  are preserved.
- A property name cannot occur more than once.
- Declared values use the same string coercion as schema-backed DAG parameters.
- Accepted undeclared values remain strings.

### `--inputs-json` Parsing

Rules:

- The flag must contain exactly one non-null JSON object followed only by JSON
  whitespace.
- Object member names must be unique at every nesting level.
- Declared values keep their JSON type and do not undergo string coercion.
- JSON string `"3"` does not satisfy an `integer` property.
- Accepted undeclared values retain their complete JSON value.

### Canonical Input

Canonical input contains:

- supplied declared properties after applicable coercion
- defaults for omitted declared properties
- accepted undeclared properties

It excludes omitted optional properties without defaults.

Canonical equality ignores object-member order and insignificant JSON
whitespace. It compares the resulting JSON values after defaults and coercion.
Reordered `--input` flags and reordered JSON object members therefore produce
the same canonical input.

### Completion Results

Successful completion writes exactly one of these lines to stdout and writes
nothing to stderr:

| Condition | Stdout |
| --- | --- |
| New completion; another node remains waiting and no step is unblocked | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run remains waiting.` |
| New completion; resume accepted | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run queued for resume.` |
| New completion; a concurrent request already queued resume | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run was already queued for resume.` |
| Identical repeat; no resume is needed | `Human task <step> was already completed.` |
| Identical repeat; the run still needs resume | `Human task <step> was already completed; DAG-run queued for resume.` |

Each line ends with one newline. Success exits zero.

A failed completion exits non-zero, writes no stdout, and writes a diagnostic
to stderr without command usage text.

### Atomicity And Persistence

A successful new completion atomically makes these observable changes:

- the selected node changes from `waiting` to `succeeded`
- canonical input becomes the immutable completion value
- generated outputs become available
- unrelated nodes remain unchanged

No observer can see only a subset of those changes. Input validation and size
checks occur before any change.

Completion state must survive the completion process exiting. The persistence
format and run-store file layout are outside this spec.

When completion identifies the stored run by its root DAG name and run ID,
changing or deleting the source DAG after the checkpoint does not change form
validation, defaults, outputs, or resume behavior for that run.

### Idempotency And Concurrency

Rules:

- Repeating completion with the same canonical input exits zero.
- An identical repeat does not change completion input or outputs.
- Repeating completion with different canonical input fails with a conflict.
- Two concurrent commands with the same canonical input both exit zero and
  converge on one completion.
- Two concurrent commands with different canonical input produce exactly one
  successful completion. The other command fails with a different-input
  conflict.
- Downstream steps execute at most once because of duplicate or concurrent
  completion commands.
- An identical repeat after the run leaves `waiting` never starts another
  resume.

### Resume And Multiple Waiting Nodes

After completion:

- If the completion unblocks a step, Dagu requests resume automatically, even
  while other nodes remain `waiting`. A step is unblocked when:
  - it has not started and declares no build inputs
  - every dependency succeeded, partially succeeded, or was skipped in a way
    that lets dependents continue
  - at least one dependency is a completed human task
- A completion never unblocks a step while any node in the run is failed,
  aborted, rejected, or retrying. Every resume re-runs those nodes, so they run
  again once, at the resume requested after no node remains `waiting`.
- Otherwise, if any node remains `waiting`, the run remains `waiting` and no
  resume is requested by that completion.
- If no node remains `waiting`, Dagu requests resume automatically.
- Resume keeps the same DAG-run ID and uses the stored DAG snapshot.
- Completed nodes, including human-task outputs, remain completed.
- Downstream nodes become eligible according to their dependencies.
- Tasks that remain open stay `waiting` with their stored prompt and artifact
  paths. The resumed run returns to a `waiting` checkpoint after no ordinary
  node remains ready or running.
- While a resumed attempt is queued or running, completing another open task
  fails with the run-not-waiting diagnostic. It succeeds once the run reaches
  its next waiting checkpoint.
- A resumed attempt checks DAG-level preconditions again (Spec 023) and runs
  `handler_on.init` again. Each return to a waiting checkpoint runs
  `handler_on.wait` again; `DAG_WAITING_STEPS` lists every step still waiting,
  including open tasks.
- If a resumed attempt ends before its next waiting checkpoint, the run leaves
  `waiting` and open tasks can no longer be completed. This happens when the
  queued resume is removed from the queue, `handler_on.init` fails, a DAG-level
  precondition is not met, the attempt is stopped, or its process dies.
  - Tasks that the attempt aborted or failed open again when the run is
    retried, with their prompt and artifact paths resolved anew.
  - Tasks left `waiting` stay open after a retry, with their stored prompt and
    artifact paths.
  - Completed task input is kept.
- A completed human task that a later retry resets opens again with its prompt
  and artifact paths resolved anew.
- A later sequential human task can create another checkpoint in the same
  logical run.

Completion is durable before resume is requested. If synchronous resume
preparation or queueing fails:

- completion remains successful and is not rolled back
- the task is not reopened
- the command exits non-zero and states that completion was stored but resume
  failed
- repeating the same completion retries resume without rewriting completion
  state

Only one successful resume can result from those retries.

After queueing succeeds, dispatch, launch, and execution follow the same
asynchronous behavior as any other queued DAG-run.

### Push-Back Command

A task that declares `with.push_back` is pushed back with:

```sh
dagu human-task push-back [flags] <root-dag-name>
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | Yes | Owning root DAG-run ID. |
| `--step` | Yes | Explicit human-task step ID. |
| `--input key=value` | No | One string feedback input; repeat for multiple properties. |
| `--inputs-json object` | No | One typed JSON feedback object. |
| `--expected-iteration n` | No | Push-back iteration of the task the operator reviewed. |

Rules:

- The DAG name, run ID, `--step`, local-context, and run-snapshot rules of the
  completion command apply.
- `--input` and `--inputs-json` follow the completion parsing rules and are
  validated against `with.push_back.form`. Omitting both supplies `{}`.
- Feedback defaults and canonical feedback input follow Form Integration and
  Canonical Input. Canonical feedback input must fit within the owning DAG's
  `max_output_size`.
- The recorded feedback values, encoded as one JSON object, must fit within
  16 KiB (16384 bytes), because every rewound step receives them as
  environment variables.
- A new push-back requires the run to be `waiting` and the task to be open.
- A task without `with.push_back` rejects push-back.
- `--expected-iteration` must be a non-negative integer. When it differs from
  the task's push-back iteration, the command fails with a conflict and changes
  nothing. Until the task opens again after its own push-back, the iteration
  that push-back started from is accepted.

### Push-Back Effects

A successful push-back atomically makes these observable changes:

- the rewind target and every step that depends on it directly or
  transitively, including the task, become not started; in a `type: build`
  DAG, a step that consumes a declared output path of one of those steps
  depends on it
- those steps lose their previous status, outputs, completion input, and
  approval decisions; human tasks and approval steps among them wait again when
  they run
- each of those steps records the new push-back iteration, the feedback, and the
  task's push-back history followed by an entry for this push-back with its
  iteration, operator, time, and feedback
- other steps remain unchanged

Feedback values are strings. A `string` property records its contents and any
other scalar records its JSON text. Only properties present in canonical
feedback input are recorded.

When a reset step runs again, it observes the push-back context of Spec 017:
`DAG_PUSHBACK`, `DAG_PUSHBACK_ITERATION`, `context.pushback.iteration`, and
`DAG_PUSHBACK_PREVIOUS_STDOUT_FILE` when it produced stdout before. Each
feedback value is also an environment variable named after its property, even
on an approval step whose `approval.input` does not list that property. The
same values are available when the reopened task resolves its prompt.

The task opens again after its dependencies finish, with its prompt and
artifact paths resolved anew. The reopened task can be completed or pushed back
again.

Input validation, the iteration check, and size checks occur before any change.

### Push-Back Results

A successful push-back writes exactly one of these lines to stdout and writes
nothing to stderr. `<target>` is the name of the rewind target.

| Condition | Stdout |
| --- | --- |
| Resume accepted | `Pushed back human task <step> to <target>; DAG-run queued for resume.` |
| A concurrent request already queued resume | `Pushed back human task <step> to <target>; DAG-run was already queued for resume.` |
| No resume requested | `Pushed back human task <step> to <target>; DAG-run remains waiting.` |
| Identical repeat; the run still needs resume | `Human task <step> was already pushed back to <target>; DAG-run queued for resume.` |
| Identical repeat; no resume is needed | `Human task <step> was already pushed back to <target>.` |

Each line ends with one newline. Success exits zero. A failed push-back exits
non-zero, writes no stdout, and writes a diagnostic to stderr without command
usage text.

### Push-Back Resume

After a push-back, Dagu requests resume when:

- no node remains `waiting`, or
- the rewind target declares no build inputs, every dependency of the rewind
  target succeeded, partially succeeded, or was skipped in a way that lets
  dependents continue, and no node in the run is failed, aborted, rejected, or
  retrying

Otherwise the run remains `waiting` and the reset steps run at the next resume.
Open tasks outside the reset steps keep their stored prompt and artifact paths.

A push-back is durable before resume is requested. If queueing the resume
fails:

- the push-back remains stored and the task does not open again
- the run stays `waiting` with its resume pending
- the command exits non-zero and states that the task was pushed back but the
  DAG-run could not be queued for resume
- repeating the same push-back retries the resume without changing the
  push-back

Only one successful resume can result from those retries.

If the run leaves `waiting` before this command queues the resume, an attempt
that another request queued or started carries the push-back. A run that
stopped instead makes the command fail with its status; the reset steps run
when the run is retried.

### Push-Back Idempotency And Concurrency

Rules:

- Each new push-back starts a new iteration.
- Until the task opens again, repeating its push-back with the same canonical
  feedback exits zero and does not change the push-back. It retries a pending
  resume, and never starts another resume after the run leaves `waiting`.
- Until the task opens again, a push-back with different canonical feedback
  fails with a conflict.
- After the task opens again, repeating a push-back pushes the task back again
  unless `--expected-iteration` names the iteration the first command saw.
- Concurrent completion and push-back of the same task produce exactly one
  successful operation.
- Two concurrent push-backs of the same task produce exactly one successful
  push-back.
- A push-back discards the completion input of every human task it resets,
  including input stored before the push-back.

### Distributed Root Runs

Rules:

- A distributed worker persists the waiting checkpoint and releases the
  attempt before completion becomes actionable.
- Completion uses the local CLI against the shared run store; it does not
  reconnect to the worker that opened the task.
- Resume keeps the same DAG-run ID and the root run's worker-selection rules.
- Resume is not forced to a local worker.
- A different selected worker can execute the resumed attempt.
- Generated outputs remain available when resume occurs on another worker.
- Push-back uses the local CLI against the shared run store, and its resume
  follows the same rules.

Coordinator RPC shape, queue representation, and worker capability negotiation
remain outside this spec.

### Dry Run

Rules:

- Dry run evaluates preconditions and resolves the prompt and artifact paths.
- A successful dry-run human task becomes `succeeded` without entering
  `waiting`.
- Dry run does not accept completion input or publish form outputs, including
  defaults.
- Dry run starts no executor process for the human task.
- A dry-run task never waits, so it accepts no push-back.

## Errors

### Validation Errors

Validation must fail without executing a step when:

- the step shape violates Step Shape
- `form` is null or is not an object
- the form root has an unsupported field or a type other than `object`
- `properties` is not an object
- a property name is invalid
- a property violates the shared scalar parameter-field rules
- `required` is not a unique list of declared property names
- `additionalProperties` is not a boolean
- a human task appears in `foreach.steps` or a handler
- `with.push_back` is null, is not an object, or has a field other than
  `rewind_to` and `form`
- `rewind_to` is missing, empty, or not a string, names the task itself, or
  names a step the task does not depend on
- the feedback form violates Form Integration or sets `additionalProperties`
  to `true`
- `with.push_back` appears in a `type: agent` DAG

The diagnostic must identify the invalid field path or unsupported step field.
Validation must not value-resolve the prompt or form.

### Runtime Opening Errors

The step fails without opening when prompt resolution fails, an artifact path
fails to resolve to a safe relative artifact path, or a precondition evaluation
fails. A child-DAG invocation fails before creating child-run state
and identifies that human tasks are not permitted in child DAGs.

### Completion Error Diagnostics

Completion diagnostics must contain the listed information:

| Failure class | Required diagnostic content |
| --- | --- |
| Remote CLI context | `human-task complete` and `local context` |
| Missing required flag | the missing flag name |
| Run store unavailable | `DAG-run store` |
| Missing run | requested DAG name and run ID |
| Unreadable run snapshot | `DAG` or `status`, plus the read failure |
| Invalid or missing step | requested step ID and `human task` |
| Run not waiting | run ID and `not waiting` |
| Invalid flag combination | `--input` and `--inputs-json` |
| Invalid `key=value` syntax | `--input` and `key=value` |
| Duplicate input property | property name and `duplicate` |
| Invalid JSON input | `--inputs-json` and `JSON` |
| Duplicate JSON member | member name and `duplicate` |
| Coercion or form validation | step ID, property name, and expected type or failed keyword |
| Acknowledgement input | step ID and `does not accept input` |
| Size limit | step ID and `maximum size` |
| Different prior input | step ID and `different input` |
| Concurrent run mutation | step ID and `changed` |
| Resume queueing failure after completion | step ID, `completed`, and `could not be queued for resume` |

The task and downstream steps remain unchanged for every failure before atomic
completion.

### Push-Back Error Diagnostics

Push-back diagnostics contain the completion diagnostic content for the same
failure class, with `human-task push-back` in place of `human-task complete`.
They also contain:

| Failure class | Required diagnostic content |
| --- | --- |
| Push-back not configured | step ID and `push_back` |
| Invalid expected iteration | `--expected-iteration` |
| Iteration mismatch | step ID, `iteration`, and the task's push-back iteration |
| Completed task | step ID and `already completed` |
| Different prior feedback | step ID and `different feedback` |
| Resume queueing failure | step ID, `pushed back`, and `could not be queued for resume` |
| Run left waiting before queueing | step ID, `left waiting`, and the run status |

The task and every other step remain unchanged for every failure before atomic
push-back.

### Abort, Timeout, And Cleanup

- A human task has no executor process to signal or clean up.
- Step retry, repeat, timeout, and signal fields are invalid.
- An open task does not expire automatically.
- A terminal or non-waiting run rejects a new completion or push-back.
- Concurrent terminal-state, completion, and push-back operations cannot
  partially overwrite each other.
- General run abort and deletion behavior is outside this spec.

## Examples

### Acknowledgement And Resume

```yaml
steps:
  - id: maintenance_started
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm that maintenance has started

  - id: continue_maintenance
    depends: maintenance_started
    run: printf 'continued\n' > continued.txt
```

With run ID `spec031-ack`, status must expose the waiting step and completion is:

```sh
dagu human-task complete \
  --run-id spec031-ack \
  --step maintenance_started \
  acknowledgement
```

The command requests resume and `continued.txt` eventually contains
`continued\n`.

### Typed Form And Outputs

```yaml
steps:
  - id: release_review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Choose the release target
      form:
        type: object
        properties:
          environment:
            type: string
            enum: [staging, production]
          replicas:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            default: 2
          notify:
            type: boolean
            default: true
        required: [environment]

  - id: record_release
    depends: release_review
    env:
      TARGET: ${steps.release_review.outputs.environment}
      REPLICAS: ${steps.release_review.outputs.replicas}
      NOTIFY: ${steps.release_review.outputs.notify}
    run: printf '%s,%s,%s\n' "$TARGET" "$REPLICAS" "$NOTIFY" > release.txt
```

```sh
dagu human-task complete \
  --run-id spec031-form \
  --step release_review \
  --input environment=production \
  typed-form
```

Canonical input is
`{"environment":"production","notify":true,"replicas":2}` and the resumed
step writes `production,2,true\n`.

### Multiple Waiting Tasks

```yaml
steps:
  - id: review_a
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm A

  - id: review_b
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm B

  - id: deploy
    depends: [review_a, review_b]
    run: printf 'deployed\n' > deployed.txt
```

Completing `review_a` leaves the run waiting because `deploy` also depends on
`review_b`, and does not create `deployed.txt`. Completing `review_b` requests
one resume and creates the file once.

### Independent Task Branches

```yaml
steps:
  - id: start
    run: printf 'start\n'

  - id: review_a
    depends: start
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm A

  - id: after_a
    depends: review_a
    run: printf 'after_a\n' > after_a.txt

  - id: review_b
    depends: start
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm B in ${DAG_RUN_ID}

  - id: finish
    depends: [after_a, review_b]
    run: printf 'finished\n' > finished.txt
```

Completing `review_a` requests resume. The resumed run creates `after_a.txt`,
returns to `waiting` on `review_b` with its stored prompt, and does not create
`finished.txt`. Completing `review_b` requests another resume and creates
`finished.txt` once.

### Review Loop

```yaml
steps:
  - id: implement
    run: printf '%s:%s\n' "$DAG_PUSHBACK_ITERATION" "$feedback" >> attempts.txt

  - id: review
    depends: implement
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Review the implementation
      push_back:
        rewind_to: implement
        form:
          type: object
          required: [feedback]
          properties:
            feedback:
              type: string

  - id: publish
    depends: review
    run: printf 'published\n' > published.txt
```

With run ID `spec031-review`, the first checkpoint leaves `attempts.txt`
containing `:\n`. The command

```sh
dagu human-task push-back \
  --run-id spec031-review \
  --step review \
  --input feedback=add-tests \
  review-loop
```

prints `Pushed back human task review to implement; DAG-run queued for resume.`
The resumed run appends `1:add-tests\n` to `attempts.txt` and returns to
`waiting` with `review` open at push-back iteration `1`. Repeating the command
with `--expected-iteration 0` fails with an iteration conflict. Completing
`review` then creates `published.txt` once.

### Stored Form Snapshot

Start a run from a fixture whose required property is `environment`. After the
checkpoint, replace the source DAG with a second static fixture whose required
property is `region`. Completion with `environment` must still succeed and
publish the original output.

### Child DAG Rejection

```yaml
steps:
  - id: run_child
    action: dag.run
    with:
      dag: child

---
name: child
steps:
  - id: review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Review child work
```

Static validation succeeds. Running `run_child` fails before child-run state is
created.

### Dry Run

```yaml
steps:
  - id: review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Review ${env.TARGET}
      form:
        type: object
        properties:
          approved_for:
            type: string
            default: dry-run
```

With `TARGET=staging`, dry run resolves the prompt and succeeds without waiting
or publishing `approved_for`.
