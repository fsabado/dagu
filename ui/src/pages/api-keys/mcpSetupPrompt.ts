Add it to my MCP client using that client's own configuration format. Keep the key out of version control: where the client supports environment variable expansion, store the key as DAGU_MCP_API_KEY and reference it from the config.

Then confirm the server is connected and that the tools dagu_read, dagu_change, and dagu_execute are listed.
